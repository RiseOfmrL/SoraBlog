            <!--These are where you'll put your images. You'll to right click on whatever image you're wanting to put here 
            and then select copy relative path. Then paste that into the part that says "src". Now you'll see two options here 
            one says multi images and the other says gallery. The difference is that one will be where you want to have 
            two or three pictures right here on the post while the other option will be for if you have a bunch of pictures 
            and you'd prefer to show off one and then have it be where if you click on it it'll pull up a gallery. 
            You can use both in one post if you'd prefer as well. Otherwise you'll just delete what you don't use. Also 
            if you're doing the multi images option and you have 2 or more pictures you want to add to the post then 
            all you need to do is copy and paste the empty line below and fill in each with the different image paths.  -->

        <!-- This is the section where you'll select your star rating if you want to. All you need to do is go into the images 
        folder and select the labeled stars and do the right click copy relative path option. Paste that into the src like 
        before.-->

        <!--This section is where you'll put your description in. All you need to do is type whatever you want in the 
        paragraph sections. You can always copy and paste more of the (p)paragraph elements with the class and it'll just 
        create a whole new paragraph for you. That way you can make it as neat as you want.-->
